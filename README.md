How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB, how to build an API using CRUD



Lessons Learned:
Nothing in tech is daunting as long as you make it fun! I love to read (fun fact: it's how I learned how to speak English), so using this theme has really enhanced my ability to learn new content. Most importantly, I learned how to incorporate thumbs up and thumbs down features to update data using MongoDB.

Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
